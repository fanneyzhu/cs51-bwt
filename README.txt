The final product is a DNA sequence aligner that takes in an input DNA reference sequence and a query sequence and attempts to map the query to all places where it appears in the reference. (Theoretically though, like all sequencing aligners, the program is essentially a glorified substring matcher that utilizes complex string transformation algorithms for efficiency in analyzing extremely large text files). Since the program is intended for analysis of large text only files and output is text only, the use of program will be entirely in the command prompt—this is actually the preferred medium of choice for bioinformatics researchers.
 
Firstly, to run the file, one will have to ensure that the environment for the Python language is installed. One can simply download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it  for your specific operating system. After python is up and running, take our .zip file “BWTAligner”, place it in a folder/directory of choice and unzip it. Put your reference sequence into a .txt file and place it in the same folder. Then open your terminal and go inside the directory where the BWTAligner file is. In the command prompt type: "python aligner.py [file].txt query". (Where your file is a text file and your query is a string that you want to find) You would then get an output in a text file that shows you how many regions in the reference sequence matches to your query string.  Click on output text file to view. Also for quick overview/for quick usage for short sequences, the command prompt will display your reference sequence with the regions that match to your query highlighted. You can also use the bwt function by running in the command line: "python bwt.py string", where string is the string that you would like to transform using bwt. The output will be the transformed string in the command prompt.
